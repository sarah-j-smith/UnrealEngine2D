# Adventure Game in Unreal Engine

My Dev Environment:

* Mac M3
* Rider
* Unreal 5.5

* Screenshot of state at end of Episode 5.

I implemented the main game logic in Unreal C++. At the present time I'm ready to move to using
the framework to make an original game, and I'm not following the tutorial from this point.

Surface level it looks very much the same as Lesser Dog's [Point and Click 2D Adventure Game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEy3c5JcLys&t=7s) on Youtube. See here for the changes:

# Learnings

* [PaperZD Animation State Machine](./Docs/AnimationStateMachine.md)
* [Managing the Commands](./Docs/CommandState.md)
* [Issues that I ran into](./Docs/Issues.md)
* [How to customise the screen resolution for other games](./Docs/ScreenAndCamera.md)
* [How to make this game from scratch](./Docs/)

## Fonts Update & Credit

* I'm using [Press Start 2 Play](https://www.zone38.net/font/) now
* [License text](./3rdParty/LICENSE.txt)

It's a full-unicode retro gaming font. As far as I can tell Cody is the original
author of this font, and its been resold many times on the internet by unethical persons.

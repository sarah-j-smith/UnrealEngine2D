1. Desert Racer - drive a car around a track avoiding obstacles
2. Gun Survivors - shoot monsters that attack from all directions
3. Crusty Pirate - platformer with attacking crabs

Covers making sprites with Paper2D, animating with flipbooks, making blueprint classes
from base classes to allow configuration in the engine, via the blueprint visual coding
language. Desert Racer and Gun Survivors both include sections on camera configuration
for 2D. The Crusty Pirate game includes the PaperZD plugin and its state machine for
automatically switching between flipbooks based on conditional tests.
